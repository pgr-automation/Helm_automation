# Using Helm with Kubernetes Namespaces

Helm provides a powerful way to manage applications in Kubernetes, including the ability to deploy them to specific namespaces. By default, Helm installs releases in the "default" namespace, but you can easily specify other namespaces for better resource organization and isolation.

## What is a Kubernetes Namespace?

Namespaces in Kubernetes provide a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users or teams. They are virtual clusters within a Kubernetes cluster, which helps in organizing and managing resources efficiently. Namespaces are useful for isolating resources, managing permissions, and maintaining cleaner cluster organization.

## Helm and Namespaces

Helm uses namespaces in Kubernetes to:
- Deploy resources to a specified namespace.
- Isolate different Helm releases (each release can be in its own namespace).
- Provide multi-tenancy and organization for teams and applications.

Helm charts often define their own default namespaces, but you can override these during installation.

## Specifying a Namespace in Helm

### Installing a Chart in a Specific Namespace

Use the `--namespace` flag to specify a namespace when installing a Helm release:

```bash
helm install my-release my-chart --namespace my-namespace
```
